Install the tool from npm:
```shell
npm i get-grid@next -g
```

I haven't documented extensively but you can run:
```shell
get-grid --help
```
to understand some quick commands easily.

If you would like to contribute, you will have to understand how [commander.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/commander) works since we are using that to create the CLI. I have tried documenting the functions in the ```app.js``` file. Feel free to optimize code, report bugs, or add new features.

You should probably read [this article on dev.to](https://dev.to/saunved/a-cli-tool-for-creating-css-grid-layouts-2aj4) to find out more about get-grid.
